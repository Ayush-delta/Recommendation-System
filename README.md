üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation
This project is a static site and does not require a backend server for initial setup.

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Ayush-delta/SkillBridge.git
cd SkillBridge
Resolve Conflicts (Critical):

Before proceeding, ensure all merge conflicts (e.g., in userlogin.html and loginuser.js) are resolved.

Manually choose the correct code blocks for each conflict (e.g., <<<<<<< HEAD vs. >>>>>>> remote_hash).

Open in Browser:

Simply open index.html in your preferred web browser to view the application.

‚öôÔ∏è Development Notes (Authentication)
The loginuser.js file handles the entire authentication flow:

Navigation: showSignIn() and showSignUp() manage page visibility.

Validation: Uses validateIndianPhoneNumber() (10 digits, starting with 6-9).

OTP Handling: The setupOtpInputs() function provides logic for automatic focusing between OTP boxes and paste functionality.

Simulation: OTP sending, verification, and account creation are simulated using console.log() and setTimeout() and should be replaced with actual API calls in a production environment.
